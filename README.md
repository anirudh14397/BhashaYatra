## First Language Pair

- **Mother Tongue**: Hindi  
- **Target Language**: Kannada  
- We'll start with 20 core everyday phrases with text + audio + voice recognition.

---

## Goals

1. Launch a prototype with one language pair.
2. Build personalized journeys — for example:  
   *“You are from Chandigarh and learning Kannada. Here's a dish from Karnataka you might like. Here's a local story from Mysuru.”*
3. Open-source the whole journey and encourage contributions from Bharat.
